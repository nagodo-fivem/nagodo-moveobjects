# Nagodo Moveobjects
This script is a tool that enables players to interact with objects in the game by grabbing and moving them around. This script enhances the experience in
your FiveM server by providing players with the ability to create unique scenarios.

## Features
- Object Grabbing: Players can grab objects within the defined reach and hold onto them.
- Object Movement: Once an object is grabbed, players can freely move it around.
- Object Release: Players can release the grabbed object at any time.

## Configuration
This script offers a range of configuration options that allow to customize its behavior.
- Objects: You can add as many objects as you want in the configuration file. This allows you to define which objects can be grabbed.
- Range: The player's reach, or the distance from which they can grab objects, can be adjusted in the configuration file. You can set the desired range to suit your server's needs.
- Keymapping: The key used to release an object is easily customizable in the game's keybind settings. For more keybind settings related to the script, refer to the keymapping.lua file
- Standalone: If you're not using any target system, both the grab and release keys can be customized within the game's keybind settings. Additionally, you can find more keybind settings specific to the script in the keymapping.lua file.
